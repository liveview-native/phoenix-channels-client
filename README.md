# Phoenix Channels

This crate implements a Phoenix Channels (v2) client in Rust.

## Status

**NOTE:** This client is still a work-in-progress, though it has enough features to support many
use cases already. The following is a list of known missing features:

- [ ] Reconnect on error/disconnect
- [ ] More thorough integration testing
- [ ] Add support for v1 protocol

## About

This client was built to support its use in the [LiveView Native core library](https://github.com/liveview-native/liveview-native-core), 
which is also implemented in Rust.

The client is implemented on top of `tokio`, and is designed for the Rust async ecosystem, though it is possible to use the
client in a non-async application, with the caveat that you still have to pull in `tokio` and its dependencies to do so.

This client is brand new, so it likely has bugs and missing features. Bug reports/feature requests are welcome though, so
if you do find any issues, please let us know on the issue tracker!

## Usage

Add to your dependencies like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
phoenix_channels_client = { version = "0.1" }
```

And in your `.cargo/config.toml`, turn on unstable tokio features we need for eg. cooperative scheduling:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["--cfg", "tokio_unstable"]
```

You can also enable nightly features using `features = ["nightly"]`, currently this only is used to make use of a few
nightly APIs for operating on slices, which we use while parsing.

## Example

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::time::Duration;

use serde_json::json;
use tokio::sync::broadcast;
use url::Url;

use phoenix_channels_client::{Event, EventPayload, Socket};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // URL with params for authentication
    let url = Url::parse_with_params(
        "ws://127.0.0.1:9002/socket/websocket",
        &[("shared_secret", "supersecret"), ("id", "user-id")],
    ).unwrap();

    // Create a socket
    let socket = Socket::spawn(url).await.unwrap();

    // Connect the socket
    socket.connect(Duration::from_secs(10)).await.unwrap();

    // Create a channel with no params
    let topic = "channel:mytopic";
    let channel = socket.channel(topic, None).await.unwrap();
    let some_event_channel = channel.clone();
    
    // Events are received as a broadcast with the name of the event and payload associated with the event
    let mut event_receiver = channel.events();
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        loop {
            match event_receiver.recv().await {
                Ok(EventPayload { event, payload }) => match event {
                    Event::User(user_event_name) => println!("channel {} event {} sent with payload {:#?}", topic, user_event_name, payload),
                    Event::Phoenix(phoenix_event) => println!("channel {} {}", topic, phoenix_event),
                },
                Err(recv_error) => match recv_error {
                    broadcast::error::RecvError::Closed => break,
                    broadcast::error::RecvError::Lagged(lag) => {
                        eprintln!("{} events missed on channel {}", lag, topic);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    });
    // Join the channel with a 15 second timeout
    channel.join(Duration::from_secs(15)).await.unwrap();
    
    // Send a message, waiting for a reply until timeout
    let reply_payload = channel.call("reply_ok_tuple", json!({ "name": "foo", "message": "hi"}), Duration::from_secs(5)).await.unwrap();

    // Send a message, not waiting for a reply
    channel.cast("noreply", json!({ "name": "foo", "message": "jeez"})).await.unwrap();

    // Leave the channel
    channel.leave().await.unwrap();
    
    // Disconnect the socket
    socket.disconnect().await.unwrap();
}
```
